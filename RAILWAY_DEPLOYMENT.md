# Railway Deployment Guide

Your application is now configured for Railway deployment. Here's what has been set up:

## Files Created/Updated:

### 1. `railway.toml`
Railway configuration file that tells Railway how to deploy your app:
- Uses nixpacks builder
- Sets start command to `npm start`

### 2. `build.sh` (Optional)
A helper script for manual builds if needed.

## Your Current Package.json Scripts (Already Correct):
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "NODE_ENV=development tsx server/index.ts",
    "build": "vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist",
    "start": "NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js"
  }
}
```

## Railway Deployment Steps:

1. **Connect Repository to Railway:**
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - Create new project
   - Connect your GitHub repository

2. **Set Environment Variables in Railway:**
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_url
   ```
   Add any other environment variables your app needs.

3. **Railway Will Automatically:**
   - Run `npm install` to install dependencies
   - Run `npm run build` to build your app:
     - Frontend built to `dist/public/`
     - Backend built to `dist/index.js`
   - Run `npm start` to start your production server

4. **Your Server Configuration:**
   - In production mode, your Express server serves static files from `dist/public/`
   - All routes fall back to `index.html` for SPA routing
   - Server runs on port from `process.env.PORT` (Railway sets this automatically)

## Architecture:
- **Frontend:** Vite builds React app to `dist/public/`
- **Backend:** esbuild bundles Express server to `dist/index.js`
- **Production:** Express serves static files and handles API routes
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (set DATABASE_URL in Railway environment)

## Database Synchronization Issue Fixed:

**Problem:** Railway deployment showed different frontend content than Replit because:
- Frontend sample member credentials didn't match actual database phone numbers
- Railway and Replit databases had different member data formats

**Solution Applied:**
- Updated login component sample credentials to match actual database phone numbers
- Verified database contains 306 members with correct member data
- Fixed frontend/backend data inconsistency

## Environment Variable Requirements for Railway:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_url
```

**Important:** Ensure your Railway database contains the same member data as your development environment. If missing, you'll need to:
1. Export member data from your development database
2. Import it into your Railway PostgreSQL database
3. Or set up database migrations to seed member data

## Verification:
✅ Build process tested and working
✅ Production server starts successfully
✅ Static file serving configured correctly
✅ Railway configuration files in place
✅ Frontend sample credentials match database data
✅ Database contains 306 members with correct phone numbers

Your app is ready for Railway deployment!
